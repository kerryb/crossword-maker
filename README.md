# Crossword maker

_A web app to take the drudgery out of building crossword grids._

You can play with the current version [here](http://kerryb.github.io/crossword-maker/).

Normally I start by drawing the grid out by hand on an index card, which can be a bit tedious.
I wanted to have a go at building a simple web app without using any fancy frameworks, and this
seemed like a good candidate.

The app is entirely client-side and static (no frameworks; no build process; no coffeescript,
jade or sass: just plain old html, javascript and css). I did use jquery and underscore though
&ndash; there are limits!

Oh, and there hardly any tests so far, which isn't so good (let's call it a
spike for now, but I'm starting to retrofit it with Jasmine specs).

## Current features

* Preset starter grids
* Automatic symmetry when blocking/unblocking cells
